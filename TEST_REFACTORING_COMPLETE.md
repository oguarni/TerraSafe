# Test Refactoring Complete - Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored `tests/test_security_scanner.py` according to all specified requirements. All 27 tests are passing.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Refactored Repeated Mocking (DRY Violation)
**File:** `tests/test_security_scanner.py` (lines 47-111)

**What was done:**
- Created a reusable `mock_filesystem()` context manager fixture using `contextlib.ExitStack`
- Consolidated ~4 repetitive `with patch(...)` blocks into a single, parameterizable fixture
- Properly mocks all filesystem operations:
  - `pathlib.Path.exists()` - file existence checks
  - `pathlib.Path.is_file()` - file type validation
  - `pathlib.Path.stat()` - file metadata (size, mtime)
  - `builtins.open()` - binary file reads for hashing

**Parameters added:**
- `file_content: bytes` - Binary content to return when file is read
- `file_size: int` - Simulated file size in bytes
- `file_exists: bool` - Whether file should appear to exist
- `file_is_file: bool` - Whether path should be a file
- `stat_side_effect: Exception` - Exception to raise from Path.stat() (NEW)
- `exists_side_effect: Exception` - Exception to raise from Path.exists() (NEW)

**Example usage:**
```python
# Normal file mocking
with mock_filesystem(file_content=b"data", file_size=1024):
    result = scanner.scan("file.tf")

# Simulate file not found
with mock_filesystem(stat_side_effect=FileNotFoundError("File not found")):
    result = scanner.scan("missing.tf")
```

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Test Isolation (test_scan_file_not_found_error)
**File:** `tests/test_security_scanner.py` (lines 315-334)

**What was done:**
- Removed direct `patch()` call in favor of the `mock_filesystem` fixture
- Now uses `mock_filesystem(stat_side_effect=FileNotFoundError(...))`
- Test verifies scanner detects missing files BEFORE calling parser
- Parser is never invoked for non-existent files (proper isolation)

**Similar fix applied to:**
- `test_scan_file_permission_error` (lines 337-357)

---

### 3. ✅ Strengthened ML Assertions
**File:** `tests/test_security_scanner.py` (lines 661-723)

**What was done:**
- Added relative scoring comparisons in ML predictor tests
- Instead of just checking `0 <= score <= 100`, now verifies:
  ```python
  # High-risk features should score significantly higher
  assert high_score > low_score + 10, \
      "High-risk features should score at least 10 points higher than low-risk"

  # Very high risk should be in upper range
  assert very_high_score > 50, \
      "Very high risk features should produce score > 50"
  ```

**Tests enhanced:**
- `test_predict_risk_with_features` - Verifies high-risk scores > low-risk scores by at least 10 points
- `test_predict_risk_anomaly_detected` - Verifies very high risk scores are in upper range (>50)
- `test_predict_risk_edge_cases` - Ensures empty features don't produce unreasonably high scores

---

### 4. ✅ Decoupled Hardcoded Scoring Logic
**Files:**
- `terrasafe/application/scanner.py` (lines 28-31, line 119)
- `tests/test_security_scanner.py` (lines 120-138)

**What was done in scanner.py:**
```python
# Added exported constants
RULE_WEIGHT = 0.6  # 60% weight for rule-based analysis
ML_WEIGHT = 0.4    # 40% weight for ML-based analysis

# Updated calculation to use constants instead of hardcoded values
final_score = int(RULE_WEIGHT * rule_score + ML_WEIGHT * ml_score)
```

**What was done in tests:**
```python
# Import weights from scanner module (with fallback)
try:
    from terrasafe.application.scanner import RULE_WEIGHT, ML_WEIGHT
except ImportError:
    RULE_WEIGHT = 0.6
    ML_WEIGHT = 0.4

# Helper function for score calculation
def calculate_expected_score(rule_score: int, ml_score: float) -> int:
    """Calculate expected final score using the same formula as the scanner."""
    return int(RULE_WEIGHT * rule_score + ML_WEIGHT * ml_score)

# Tests now use dynamic calculation instead of magic numbers
expected_score = calculate_expected_score(20, 45.5)
assert results['score'] == expected_score
```

**Benefits:**
- No more magic numbers in tests
- Single source of truth for scoring weights
- Tests automatically adapt if weights change
- Clear documentation of scoring formula

---

### 5. ✅ Converted to Pytest Functional Style
**File:** `tests/test_security_scanner.py` (entire file)

**Major changes:**
1. **Removed unittest imports**, added pytest
2. **Converted classes to fixtures:**
   - `TestSecurityRuleEngine` → `@pytest.fixture def rule_engine()`
   - `TestIntelligentSecurityScanner` → `@pytest.fixture def scanner_with_mocks()`
   - `TestMLPredictor` → `@pytest.fixture def ml_predictor()`
   - etc.

3. **Converted all test methods to functions:**
   - `class TestX: def test_y(self):` → `def test_y(fixture):`
   - Removed all `self` references
   - Tests now receive dependencies via fixtures

4. **Replaced assertion methods:**
   - `self.assertEqual(a, b)` → `assert a == b`
   - `self.assertIn(x, y)` → `assert x in y`
   - `self.assertGreater(a, b)` → `assert a > b`
   - `self.assertRaises(E)` → `pytest.raises(E)`
   - `self.skipTest("msg")` → `pytest.skip("msg")`

5. **Added comprehensive fixtures** (lines 145-186):
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def rule_engine():
       """Fixture providing a SecurityRuleEngine instance."""
       return SecurityRuleEngine()

   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_scanner_components():
       """Fixture providing mocked scanner dependencies."""
       return {'parser': Mock(), 'rule_analyzer': Mock(), 'ml_predictor': Mock()}

   @pytest.fixture
   def scanner_with_mocks(mock_scanner_components):
       """Fixture providing an IntelligentSecurityScanner with mocked dependencies."""
       return IntelligentSecurityScanner(...)

   @pytest.fixture
   def real_scanner():
       """Fixture providing an IntelligentSecurityScanner with real components."""
       return IntelligentSecurityScanner(...)

   @pytest.fixture
   def temp_model_dir():
       """Fixture providing a temporary directory for model storage."""
       temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
       yield temp_dir
       shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)
   ```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner, more Pythonic code
- Better fixture reuse
- Consistent with `test_api.py` style
- Easier to read and maintain
- Better separation of concerns

---

## Additional Files Modified

### `tests/conftest.py` (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:** Sets up test environment variables before module imports

**Why needed:**
- Settings validation happens at import time
- Need to configure environment before terrasafe modules are imported
- Prevents `ValidationError` for API key hash and other settings

**Content:**
```python
# Set up environment variables before any imports
os.environ['TERRASAFE_API_KEY_HASH'] = '$2b$12$PNgLco0IOSrOI5e7Rt2IPuLZWBjhU8pUhW3UkhQMOi/QuamsfdPEe'
os.environ['TERRASAFE_ENVIRONMENT'] = 'development'
os.environ['TERRASAFE_DATABASE_URL'] = 'postgresql+asyncpg://test:test@localhost:5432/test'
os.environ['TERRASAFE_REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://localhost:6379'
os.environ['TERRASAFE_LOG_LEVEL'] = 'INFO'
```
