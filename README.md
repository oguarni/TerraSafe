# TerraSafe - Intelligent Terraform Security Scanner

An AI-powered security scanner for Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files that combines rule-based detection with machine learning anomaly detection.

## 📝 1. Problem Definition

### Context
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has revolutionized cloud deployments, but misconfigurations remain the #1 cause of cloud security breaches. According to Gartner, 99% of cloud security failures through 2025 will be the customer's fault, primarily due to misconfigurations.

### Importance
- **$5 million** - Average cost of a cloud breach (IBM Security Report 2024)
- **70%** of organizations experienced IaC security incidents in the past year
- Manual security reviews are slow and error-prone

### Why AI is Appropriate
Traditional rule-based scanners miss complex patterns and novel attack vectors. Machine learning can:
- Detect anomalous configurations not covered by rules
- Learn from new threat patterns
- Provide confidence scoring for risk assessment
- Adapt to organization-specific security baselines

## 🎯 2. Proposed Solution

**TerraSafe** is an intelligent system that combines:
- **Rule-based detection** for known vulnerabilities (deterministic)
- **Anomaly detection ML** for unknown risks (probabilistic)
- **Hybrid scoring** that weights both approaches

### Task Classification
- **Primary**: Anomaly Detection (unsupervised learning)
- **Secondary**: Risk Classification (pattern recognition)
- **Output**: Security risk scoring and vulnerability identification

### Input/Output Specification
- **Input**: Terraform .tf files (HCL format)
- **Processing**: Dual-path analysis (deterministic + probabilistic)
- **Output**: Risk score (0-100), vulnerabilities list, confidence level

## 🤖 4. Algorithm Choice

### Selected: Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
**Justification:**
- Excellent for detecting outliers in security configurations
- Unsupervised - doesn't need labeled attack data
- Fast training and inference
- Works well with small datasets

### Why Not Other Algorithms:
- **Neural Networks**: Overkill for structured config data, needs more training data
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Better for optimization, not detection
- **Decision Trees**: Too rigid for anomaly detection

## 💻 5. Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.8+ | Best ML ecosystem, clean syntax |
| **ML Framework** | Scikit-learn | Production-ready, Isolation Forest implementation |
| **Parser** | python-hcl2 | Native HCL2 support for Terraform |
| **Pattern Matching** | re (regex) | Built-in, efficient for rule-based detection |
| **Numerical** | NumPy | Efficient array operations for features |
| **Model Persistence** | Joblib | Optimized for scikit-learn models |

## 📊 Results & Test Files

### Test Configurations

The project includes three test configurations demonstrating different security levels:

#### 1. `vulnerable.tf` - High Risk (Score: 90-100)
Contains critical security issues:
- Open SSH access from internet (0.0.0.0/0)
- Hardcoded database passwords  
- Unencrypted storage (RDS, EBS)
- Public S3 bucket access

**ML Detection**: High anomaly score due to multiple security anti-patterns

#### 2. `secure.tf` - Low Risk (Score: 0-20)
Follows security best practices:
- Restricted network access (private subnets only)
- Variables for sensitive data
- Encrypted storage enabled
- S3 public access blocked

**ML Detection**: Normal pattern, low anomaly score

#### 3. `mixed.tf` - Medium Risk (Score: 40-60)
Partially secure configuration:
- Public HTTP (acceptable for web servers)
- SSH restricted to internal network ✓
- Database encrypted ✓
- S3 partially restricted

**ML Detection**: Slight anomaly due to mixed security posture

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all three tests
./run_demo.sh

# Or test individually
python security_scanner.py test_files/vulnerable.tf
python security_scanner.py test_files/secure.tf

### Understanding the Hybrid Scoring System

The scanner uses a **weighted hybrid approach**:

1. **Rule-based Score (60% weight)**: Deterministic detection of known vulnerabilities
   - CRITICAL issues: 30 points each
   - HIGH issues: 20 points each
   - MEDIUM issues: 10 points each

2. **ML Anomaly Score (40% weight)**: Isolation Forest detects unusual patterns
   - Trained on baseline security configurations
   - Detects deviations from normal security patterns
   - Provides confidence level based on anomaly distance

3. **Final Score**: `0.6 × Rule Score + 0.4 × ML Score`

### Score Interpretation
- **0-30**: Secure configuration ✅
- **31-60**: Some issues, review recommended ⚠️
- **61-100**: Critical issues, immediate action required ❌

### Feature Vector Analysis

The ML model analyzes these features:
- Number of open ports to internet
- Presence of hardcoded secrets
- Public access configurations
- Unencrypted storage instances
- Total resource count

Example feature vectors from tests:
- **Vulnerable**: `[2, 1, 1, 2, 5]` → High anomaly
- **Secure**: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5]` → Normal pattern
- **Mixed**: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 4]` → Moderate anomaly
